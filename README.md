### Project Description
This project is a simple chatbot that responds only with binary outputs (0s and 1s). Additionally, it changes the screen color every second and continuously rotates the mouse pointer, creating a dynamic and visually engaging but minimalistic interaction.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The ‚Äúproblem‚Äù this project tackles is the lack of truly useless or absurd software that serves no practical purpose but still entertains or intrigues users. It humorously highlights how technology can be playful and nonsensical, challenging traditional expectations of usefulness in software by rotating a mouse pointer continuously and changing screen colors while only communicating in binary.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The solution is a delightfully pointless yet entertaining program that communicates only in binary, spinning the mouse pointer nonstop while flashing the screen with color changes every second. By combining these quirky features, it turns your computer into a playful distraction machine that solves the non-problem of boredom‚Äîbecause sometimes, the best solution is no solution at all!
